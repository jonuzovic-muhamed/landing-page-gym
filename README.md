## About
This project is part of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>'s foundations course, which I undertook in order to increase my skill level in modern web development.

For this project it was neecessary to create a simple landing webpage using the HTML and CSS knowledge learned prior to it.

I created the landing page for a fictionary Fitness Studio/Gym.
